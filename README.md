# MC3DS-SimplePack
SimplePack 3DS enhances the Minecraft experience on the New Nintendo 3DS by delivering an 8x8 texture style that better aligns with the console's lower screen resolution. Unlike the default 16x16 textures, these redesigned 8x8 graphics provide clearer visuals, making the game easier on the eyes and enhancing immersion in Minecraft's blocky world.
